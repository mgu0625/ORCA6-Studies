# Hydroquinone (HYQ) ORCA 6 Computational Demonstration

### 1 Hartree (Eh) = 27.2114 eV = 630 kcal/mol = 2600 kJ / mol = $2.2 x 10^5 cm^{-1}$ = 1/13.6 Bohr

### 1. Introduction & Experimental Relevance
HYQ is an aromatic organic compound with formula $C_6G_4(OH)_2$ consisting of 14 atoms. 

It is widely studied due to its redox properties, bonding capabilities, and role in various chemical and biological processes;

Commonly used for:
	- **Photochemistry**: Excellent reducing agent, critical for radical chemistry
	- **Electrochemistry**: Undergoes reversible oxidation to quinone
	- **Spectroscopy**: Characterized via UV-vis, IR and Raman Spectroscopy
	- **Solubility & Solvent Effects**: Solubility varies in different solvents, making **solvent modeling** crucial for comparison with experimental results

# Step-by-Step Computational Workflow

## 1. Gas-Phase Optimization and Frequency Calculation

Functionals Used
- GGA: PBE, BLYP, BP86
- Hybrid-GGA: PBE0, B3LYP
- meta-GGA: TPSS, B97M-D3BJ

Basis Set Used: def2-SVP

**Sample Input files in /ORCA6-NOTES/input_files**

Things to Note:
   - **TightSCF**: Used to ensure more accurate SCF convergence by reducing the energy and density error thresholds, resulting in a more precise electronic structure calculation.
   - **VerytightOPT**: Used to impose stricter convergence criteria on optimization calculation, ensuring minimal residual forces on atoms and resulting in a highly optimized structure with accurate bond lengths and angles/
  
#### After Calculation of Geometry Optimization
- Check bottom of `.out` file to ensure calculation terminated

- Use ChemCraft (Reccommended for ORCA users) or other visualizing software (Avogadro, VMD, MacmolPlt etc.,) to visualize optimized structures

- Takeaways from HYQ calculation:
  	- ΔE (in eV) was calculated as: $ΔΕ(eV) = (Ε_{functional} - E_{lowest}) x 27.2114 = (E_{f} - E_{i})$
  	- $E_{final}$ located towards botton of .inp
  	  
		<img width="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a8fbf7c-d9bc-4403-8c75-be5d0217fab0" />
 
        - $E_{initial}$ is found right under where it **first** mentions SCF Converged

       	- Python Script (attached to /script) was used to extract bond lengths and RMSD
  	    	- automated by parsing .xyz file to find the optimized coordinate and to reference for evaluating structural deviation (Make sure to know Atom Numbers, can visualize using Avogadro)

  	- meta-GGAs, gives large |ΔE|, showcasing significant shift.

- Computational Cost vs Accuracy:
  	- Some basis sets converged faster but most likely sacrificed accuracy.
  	- RIJCOSX-based hybrid-GGA functionals (e.g., PBE0, B3LYP) showed more accuracy HOWEVER, required longer computational times.
  	- def2/J + RI on sets optimized under a min while using RIJCOSX increased computational time to under 5 minutes.

#### Notes from Concluding Frequency Calculation on HYQ
- B3LYP showed most stable energy with lowest final SCF energy (-382.197 Eh) suggesting better stabilization in comparison to PBE0.
- PBE showed least stable energy structure with highest final SCF energy (-381.861 Eh) suggesting less stable electronic structure
- PBE showed highest ZPE energy, indicating inadequate vibrational scaling or missed contributions (most likely from Error of attempting to use D3BJ with parameters).
- Corrected $ΔΗ_{corr}$ and $ΔG_{corr}$ followed trend of B3LYP > PBE0 > PBE, reinforcing B3LYP's stronger stabilization
- Similar $ΔS_{final}$ indicate similar vibrational contributions across all functionals.
- B3LYP overall showed most thermodynamically stable functional for this system with PBE0 being comparatively stable but with slightly less stability as indicated by higher energies. 
 
Error when attempting to use D3BJ Dispersion Correction with PBE functional (Following DOI: 10.1063/1.4907719 and DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00780)

- Most likely due to ORCA's limited support for D3BJ with PBE despite specifying parameters in input file.
- PBE is pure DFT and ORCA typically applices D3 for pure GGA functionals [Read About it More](https://www.faccts.de/docs/orca/6.0/manual/contents/detailed/model.html)

## 2. Solvent Effect Analysis

### CPCM Solvation Model Calculation
- Make sure to put CPCM(solventname) next to keyword and specify dielectric constant under `%cpcm`
- `surface_type Gaussian` was implemented to CPCM to determine how solvent cavity is constructed
  	- Without, default tessellataion-based cavity is constructed (calculated with and without  Gaussian-based cavity constructions)
  

##### Solent Used for HYQ Calculations:
- Acetonitrile
- Water
- DMSO
- n-Hexane

## 3. Electronic Structure Analysis

**NBO (Natural Bond Analysis (Optional)** provides insight into the electronic structure of molecules by describing its interactions in terms of localized orbitals.
	Couldn’t run NBO on HYQ bc NBO is an extension of ORCA that has to be purchased… 
 
[NBO Purchase Cite if Interested](https://nbo6.chem.wisc.edu/)

#### MO Visualization (VMD for this tutorial)
1. Generated .cube files by requesting from orca via single point energy calculation
  	For Keyword, `! RKS def2-SVP RIJCOSX LIBXC(B3LYP) TightSCF PrintBasis`
  	Under `%plots`

<img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/220d2952-6316-4a2e-a3e8-a459fece7a03" />

  - Used .xyz generated from GasPhase Frequency calculation done with B3LYP
- Also tried split basis set (Used "def2-TZVP" for O)

2. Load .xyz used for single point energy calculation as  "New Molecule" -> Loaded .cube files as "Visualization State"

Spin Density of HYQ (visualized on VMD)

- The isosurfaces appeared sliced for both spin density and MO because
	- Isosurface was possibly too big, when made to 0.5, it didn't appear "sliced"
 		- Tried to regenerate the .cube file by rerunning single point energy calculation with different requested dimensions but did not show improvement.. 
   	- Also made bonds thicker, changed background back and forth, added labels to see which atoms are lacking in electron density visibly.
 
- adding labels to atoms (on VMD Main Tab, Click Extension -> Tk Console) and type
  	`set all [atomselect top all]`
Followed by

<img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b51a90df-82e8-4212-b71f-5cb38a39bfd7" />

*** My struggle here was to show labels through the isosurfaces, I tried the following command amongst a few others but was not successful. Removed labels in the end after assuring which atoms corresponded to which labels aligned with .xyz file.

`display depthcue off`, `graphics top on`

Tried verifying and redrawing labels but also didn't work.

<img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c747d8cc-7935-4ff7-bc0f-e0a4f8936064" />


Changed background to white: `color Display Background white`

Make Bonds Thicker: ` mol modstyle 0 0 Bonds 0.08`
