# Maleimide Transition State and 3D PES Plotting and Another attempt at NTO analysis 🤞🏼🤞🏼

Tutorial followed: [YouTubeLink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKJRaC240vg)

### Goal of This Study:
1. obtain 2 separate geometry coordiantes 
2. practice setting up coordinate for TS
3. use dummy atoms to setup the energy scan
4. visualize progress in avogadro
5. obtain 3D PES
6. Attempt at NTO analysis via TDDFT

------
## 1. Obtaining 2 seperate geometry coordinates

- 1st coordinate used was from initial frequency calculation done in previous `/ORCA6-Studies/casestudies/MaleimideStudy.md`
- Geometry Optimization was redone on structure built on Avogadro to obtain 2nd coordinates

One of the structure was copy-pasted to the other file
