# This is A Demonstrative Study as Well as Test Study of Broken Symmetry DFT Calculation 

Compound of Interest: $[CuCl_4]^{2-}$

Why Study $[CuCl_4]^{2-}$?
- To obtain better knowledge of electronic structure of related properties where halide ions are sole ligands
- observe JT-distortion, spin contamination effects,
