# This is A Demonstrative Study as Well as Test Study of Broken Symmetry DFT Calculation 

Compound: $[CuCl_4]^{2-}$

###  Why is CuCl4 A Field of Interest?

- In Spectroscopic Fields: Studying Crystal Field(CF) Theory and Jahn-Teller(JT) Distortion via its d-d transitions in Cu(II).
- In Theoretical Fields: To benchmark DFT theories, explore electron correlation effects in $d^9$ systems, and to model Ligand Field (LF) theory and molecular orbital theory (MOT) modeling as well as studying solvation effects.
- In Organic and Biochem Fields: Understanding metal ion partitioning for separations and environmental cleanup

Outside of Chemistry:
- Color-changing reaction demo for education
- Art and visual design via $[CuCl_4]^{2-}$ pigments
